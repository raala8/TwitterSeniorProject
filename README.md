# TwitterSeniorProjec
## Introduction

The Twitter Senior Project is an open-source initiative with the goal of recreating the genuine twitter experience. The project is developed in JavaScript and makes use of a number of libraries and software packages that are included in the android studio program and firebase. The project is open for usage, modification, and contribution. This GitHub repo contains all the code required for the frontend and the backend. The objectives of this project are:
+ Account creation and login functionality.
+Allows for posting, viewing, and editing tweets.
+ Share posts with others outside of the platform.
+View personal profile and change profile picture
## Requirements & Getting Started

You must have Android studio installed on your PC in order to execute the Twitter Senior Project. The prerequisite libraries needed to successfully execute the program are all included in the code. Additionally, the backend needed to run the app is embedded in the app. The backend uses firebase.

Clone this repo onto your local machine.
```
git clone https://github.com/raala8/TwitterSeniorProject
```
Then install android studio:
```

```
Now open the project on android studio(it should be saved in the base user directory), set up the emulator, and run the application

## Data Sources

The Twitter Senior Project accesses real-time data on our servers to display user accounts and posts. Text, user information, and metadata like retweets, likes, and timestamps are all included in the data storage.


## Contents of the code


The scripts used in the Twitter Senior Project each carry out a distinct task. Initial sign in is done by the file SigninActivity.kt. Additionally the user has the option to create an account, which will be done through RegisterActivity.kt. Once in, the user can do a variety of tasks like viewing other tweets and posting their own tweets. In addition to these base features, we implemented the heavily requested feature of editing tweets, allowing users to change their posts if they made some sort of error within the original post. These various activity files work in tandem with our xml files to bring about a user experience that very closely resembles the real twitter app.
 

## Testing and Results

To assure the quality and dependability of the data, the Twitter Senior Project has undergone a thorough testing process. To make sure that the frontend and backend work reliably, our team made several accounts and have rigorously tweaked and updated all features included in the app.

There are several interesting insights into Twitter patterns and behavior that have come from the Twitter Senior Project. Our main insights have come in the form of seeing first hand how these social media apps use a variety of techniques to implement a variety of features and maintain a positive overall experience for users.
